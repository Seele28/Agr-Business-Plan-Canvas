            <h3>What is a Business Canvas?</h3>
            <p>
                A Business Canvas is a strategic tool that visually outlines the key components of a business, including value propositions, customers, and revenue streams, to help plan and communicate ideas effectively.
            </p>
            <h3>Why a New Agriculture Business Model?</h3>
            <p>
                The unique challenges of agriculture, such as seasonal cycles and specialized cost structures, require a tailored business model to ensure efficiency and sustainability.
            </p>
            <h3>Our Model</h3>
            <p>
                Our model adapts the traditional Business Canvas to the specific needs of the agriculture industry, focusing on factors like seasonal variability, resource management, and specialized customer segments. 
                By simplifying the process and offering intuitive guidance, our platform helps agri-entrepreneurs create actionable, industry-specific business strategies with ease.
